Python Voice Recorder üéôÔ∏è
Overview
This is a simple Python project that allows you to record audio for a specified duration and save it as a .wav file. It utilizes the sounddevice and scipy libraries for handling audio input and file writing

Features
üéß Records audio in real-time.
üíæ Saves the recording as a .wav file.
üõ†Ô∏è Easy to use and customize.


Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Required libraries:

#Copy code
pip install sounddevice scipy

How It Works
The program records audio from your system's default microphone.
The duration of the recording is determined by the user.
The recorded audio is saved as a .wav file at the specified location.


Run the Code:
Save the script in a .py file (e.g., voice_recorder.py).
Execute it in the terminal or IDE of your choice.
bash
#Copy code
python voice_recorder.py
The program will start recording for the specified duration (e.g., 10 seconds) and save the audio as a .wav file.



Project Structure
voice_recorder.py: Main script for recording and saving audio.
Recordsave.wav: Example output file after running the program.

Future Enhancements
Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier use.
Include an option to select different audio formats like .mp3.
Improve error handling for missing libraries or microphone issues.
